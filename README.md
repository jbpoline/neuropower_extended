## neuropower improved

Power estimations for fMRI data.
The aim of neuropower is to provide power estimations for fMRI analyses.  We aim to find power estimates:
- without a cluster forming threshold
- for a large range of type I error corrections â€”> full ROC estimation
- for a range of subjects, this will allow sample size calculations
- using own data, known effect sizes, or using estimates for effect sizes from different (open) sources
